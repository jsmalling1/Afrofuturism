        <h3>History</h3>

        <p><h6>In a 1970s essay with the provocative title of “Why Blacks Don't Read Science Fiction,” the late African-American writer Charles R. Saunders reflected bitterly on the prevalence of anti-Blackness in the genre. Although white American science-fiction writers “were capable of stretching their imaginations to the point of conceptualizing aliens with sympathetic qualities,” he mused, “a black man or woman in a spacesuit was an image beyond the limits of [their] imaginations.... If blacks appeared at all in the pages of the science fiction pulp magazines, they were presented as offensive ‘darkie' stereotypes.” The genre, as Saunders memorably put it, was “as white as a Ku Klux Klan meeting.”
            <br>

            <br>

        In the years since Saunders's acerbic observations, Black writers have undoubtedly become more prominent in speculative fiction. But given white men's continual dominance of the genre, nonwhite authors are all too frequently still overlooked.
            <br>

            <br> 
        The term “Afrofuturism” was introduced by scholar Mark Dery in 1993, as a way of defining existing trends that focused on Black literature and 1980s technoculture. But Afrofuturist tendencies have been a part of art, literature, and music almost since the birth of modern science fiction at the beginning of the nineteenth century. Black to the Future - questioned why so few African Americans write science fiction, a genre whose close encounters with the other, the stranger in a strange land would seem uniquely suited to the concerns of African American novelists.</h6>
